**My BOX**

This Project called My box (I just named it randomly), so user/you can creating bunch of category and each category also have theirs own item. tbh I just plainly pick something in my mind so I create this. Using MVVM or Model-View-Viewmodel to creating this because wanna make more understanding in thoose architectures.

- **Firebase Storage** used to keep the img from user,

- **Firebase Realtime Databases** used to like back-end of the project, If you ask me why not using firestore, I will ask the same to my self lol
So the realtime db nodes I've been done are like this,

- **Firebase Auth** for interact with the realtime db so it can be "safe" and another reason for using auth in this project are to grouping each user category/items and data like names/email by the UID that's the firebase auth provides.

If you wonder why using personal data for user, I just want to make greetings in the main screen of the apps like this... nothing else...
